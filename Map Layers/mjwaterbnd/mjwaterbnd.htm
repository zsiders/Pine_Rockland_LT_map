This data is provided "as is". GeoPlan relied on the integrity of the original

The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using
either ESRI SDC Data Development Kit Professional 2 (DDKP2) or tools in
ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then loaded into ArcSDE to verify and validate
the geometry.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<strong><b>DATA LINEAGE SUMMARY: </b></strong>
<br />
<table width="60%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
This file was originally digitized by the National Mapping Division based
on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States
of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The 1:2,000,000-scale Digital
Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a single national hydrography
coverage. Where necessary to effect the merge, alignment changes were
made.  The names were taken from the USGS Topographic 1:100,000-scale
maps.  For Alaska, the names were taken from the USGS Topographic
1:250,000-scale maps.  State lines across water bodies were removed from
the national coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the features.

Some spatial features were added and corrected.  Some name attributes
were added or corrected.  All occurrences of St. were changed to Saint.
Extra spaces were removed from the attributes.  Hydrographic features
for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added. A minor adjustment
was made to the shoreline in Galveston Bay, Texas. The linear water feature
attribute value, Intercoastal waterway, was changed to Intracoastal waterway.
Process Date: 200212
<br />
The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the compressed
file from the National Atlas of the United States and extracted it. Removed
unneeded attributes. Removed all records except those with FEATURE
attribute types of "Canal", "Glacier", "Lake", "Lake Dry", "Lake Intermittent",
"Reservoir", "Reservoir Intermittent", "Stream", and "Swamp or Marsh".
Reduced the attribute widths of FEATURE and NAME. Added attribute SQMI
and calculated its values. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj),
and spatial indices.
Process Date: 20050317
<br />
GeoPlan downloaded the data from the ESRI ArcGIS 9 Data and Maps
DVD in the Albers HGPN GCS_North_American_1983 projection. The data
was reprojected into the Albers Conical Equal Area (Florida Geographic
Data Library) projection.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dissolved layer to get rid of roads that criss cross the large areas (e.g. The Everglades)
- Changed layer name from WATER_BODIES to MJWATERBND.
- Selected features within and intersecting the state of Florida.
- Added a DESCRIPT field based on NAME.
- Added FGDLAQDATE based on date FGDL acquired the data.
- Added AUTOID field.
- Upcased fields.
Process Date: 20080613

Data imported to ArcSDE and exported as a shapefile.
